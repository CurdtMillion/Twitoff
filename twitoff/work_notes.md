### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Module 1:  This time trying to get the data onto the db was a little challenging. I eventually had to db.session.rollback() [becaise I kept getting an error] and
           then readded the User/Tweet info one at a time and commited after each User/Tweet. This worked.
