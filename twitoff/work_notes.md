### Twitoff Project DS Unit 3 Sprint 3
Link to work:  https://github.com/CurdtMillion/Twitoff

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Module 1:  What went well was the fact that I have a working database with data I can actually query in db_browser!

Module 2:  What went well was getting the flask app to run and display the twitoff start page.
Update - Granted twitter dev access, and this module is now complete!

Module 3:  What went well was accessing the Jupyter notebook, and playing around in that.




### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Module 1:  I am surprised by how understandable it was.

Module 2:  I find it very interesting how the flask shell runs all of the script files together to form this program.
Update - After getting twitter dev access, the ease of adding users/tweets to db was a surprisingly smooth process.

Module 3:  


### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Module 1:  This time trying to get the data onto the db was a little challenging. I eventually had to db.session.rollback() [becaise I kept getting an error] and
then readded the User/Tweet info one at a time and commited after each User/Tweet. This worked.

Module 2:  Getting errors: 'list' object has no attribute 'id' & Class 'builtins.list' is not mapped. I am trying to figure out what code I need for the twitter scraper and what I do not need from Bruno's example of twitter.py.
Update - After getting twitter dev access, I encountered no errors.
